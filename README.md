### **Outpost: Game Development Plan**

---

#### **1. Game Overview**

**Title:** Outpost  
**Genre:** 2D Base-Building, Real-Time Strategy, Roguelike  
**Platform:** PC (initially), with potential for expansion to other platforms  
**Inspiration:** Inspired by *Rymdkapsel* and other strategic base-building games.  
**Objective:** Players manage a robotic crew to expand their outpost on a hostile planet, defend against waves of increasingly difficult enemies, and survive as long as possible.

---

#### **2. Core Concept**

**Gameplay Summary:**  
The player starts with a small headquarters and must expand the base by building various structures, managing resources, and defending against waves of enemies. Each wave presents unique challenges, with different enemy types, increasing difficulty, and environmental hazards. The game progresses through a series of stages, each represented by five waves, where the nature of the enemies evolves and adapts to the player’s actions.

#### **3. Key Features**

**Base-Building Mechanics:**
- **Modular Expansion:** Players build their base by selecting different types of buildings (e.g., defense, resource production, research) from a pool of possible structures. The specific building provided is randomized from the available options, encouraging adaptability and strategic planning.
- **Grid-Based Layout:** Buildings are placed on a grid, expanding the base outward. Players must manage space effectively to create efficient layouts while balancing defense and resource generation.
- **Connectivity:** Buildings must be connected by corridors or paths, which serve as routes for workers and resources, as well as potential choke points for defense against enemies.
- **Resource Management:** Players gather and manage various resources, such as minerals and energy, which are required to build and upgrade structures.

**Wave-Based Enemy System:**
- **Thematic Waves:** The game is divided into stages, with each stage consisting of five waves. Each stage features a specific theme for its enemies (e.g., bugs, alien beasts, hostile tribes). Enemies become progressively stronger with each wave, culminating in a boss wave.
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** Enemies adapt to the player’s strategy, targeting weak points and employing different tactics, forcing the player to continuously adjust their approach.
- **Environmental Hazards:** As the base expands, the environment may react with hazards such as toxic storms, earthquakes, or enemy ambushes, adding an additional layer of challenge.

**Building and Unit Types:**
- **Defense Structures:** Various defensive buildings like turrets, walls, and traps that players can place strategically around their base. Some defenses are more effective against specific types of enemies.
- **Production Facilities:** Buildings that generate resources or convert one type of resource into another. For example, a factory could produce basic materials, while a refinery upgrades those materials into advanced components.
- **Research Labs:** Enable the player to unlock new technologies, upgrade existing defenses, and gain intelligence about upcoming enemy waves.
- **Worker Robots:** Basic units responsible for gathering resources, constructing buildings, and repairing damaged structures.
- **Combat Drones:** Defensive units that engage enemies, each with specialized roles (e.g., anti-air, ground defense, or swarm management).

**Upgrade System:**
- **Building Upgrades:** Players can upgrade existing buildings to improve their functionality, increase durability, or enhance their effects.
- **Tech Tree:** A branching tech tree allows players to unlock new units, buildings, and abilities, catering to different playstyles.

**Random Events and Challenges:**
- **Randomized Building Selection:** When building new structures, the specific building is randomly selected from a pool, introducing an element of unpredictability.
- **Random Events:** Periodic events such as resource bonuses, environmental hazards, or rogue AI incidents that require the player to adapt quickly.

#### **4. Story and Setting**

**Setting:**  
The game is set on a distant, uncharted planet where the player’s outpost is established to mine resources and explore the environment. The planet is teeming with hostile life forms, and the deeper the player digs or expands, the more dangerous the environment becomes.

**Story Progression:**  
The narrative unfolds through the different stages of enemy waves. As the player progresses through each set of waves, they uncover more about the planet’s history, the origin of the enemies, and the ultimate threat they face.
